# 🌀 Eternal Loader

A beautifully pointless website that never finishes loading.  
Perfect for procrastinators, existential crises, or just vibing with your Wi-Fi.

### 🚀 Features

- Fake progress bar that goes to 99% and never loads
- Hilarious loading messages like:
  - “Rebooting the backend hamster...”
  - “Negotiating with the server overlords…”
  - “Still faster than your group project leader”

### 💡 Why?

Because some things are better when they go nowhere.

### 📜 License

MIT — use it, remix it, break it. Just don’t make it actually load.
